##  Features

- RAMsey has a very detailed stats board and it displays all of your statistics without error!
- Fast performance - You can count on RAMsey to run the second you open it without any ridiculous waiting times.
- Sleek UI, this should be easy to navigate, using QWidget with Python it was very easy to accomplish this.
